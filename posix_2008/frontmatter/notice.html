<h5>Patents</h5>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">Attention is called to the possibility that
implementation of this standard may require use of subject matter covered by patent rights. By publication of this standard, no
position is taken with respect to the existence or validity of any patent rights in connection therewith. A patent holder or patent
applicant has filed a statement of assurance that it will grant licenses under these rights without compensation or under
reasonable rates, with reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination to applicants
desiring to obtain such licenses. Other Essential Patent Claims may exist for which a statement of assurance has not been received.
The IEEE and The Open Group are not responsible for identifying Essential Patent Claims for which a license may be required, for
conducting inquiries into the legal validity or scope of Patents Claims, or determining whether any licensing terms or conditions
are reasonable or non-discriminatory. Further information may be obtained from the IEEE Standards Association and The Open
Group.</font></p>
